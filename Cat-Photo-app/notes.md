# HTML notes

## Step 1

HTML elements have opening tags like
`html<h1> and closing tags like </h1>.`
The text an element will display goes between its opening and closing tags.

## Step2

The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.

Example Code

```html
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
```

Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

## step3

The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.

## Step 4

Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->.

## step 5

HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

Example Code

```html
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
```
